# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a part of my internship with **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**.

## 🔍 Overview

A logistic regression model is used to classify whether a news article is **real or fake** using TF-IDF vectorization.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone this repo.
2. Place `True.csv` and `Fake.csv` inside a folder named `datasets`.
3. Run `main.py`.

## 📈 Output

The model prints:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
